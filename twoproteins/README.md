This short example shows how to: 
- download protein files from RCSB with PyMOL
- create and delete objects and selections
- use the basic functionality of align command
- get the protein's sequence
- iterate over the atoms using separate namespaces
- write molecules to file
- draw a figure with different representations for protein, ligands and water.

Run it with pymol -c example.py or pymol example.py
